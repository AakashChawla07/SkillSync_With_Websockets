# SkillSync

SkillSync is a web-based platform for college coding society members to track their technical learning journeys, discover peers with similar interests, and receive structured mentorship from seniors.

### Challenge Faced by Students
Students often work in silos without knowing what others in the society are learning.
There's no centralized system for tracking skill development or connecting with mentors.
Seniors are unaware of juniors' progress and canâ€™t offer targeted help or opportunities.
Lack of peer visibility limits collaboration and slows community growth.
### Our Solution
SkillSync provides a centralized, community-first system where:

Every member can define their learning domains and set goals.
Weekly progress reports offer personalized feedback and encouragement.
Domain-specific pages bring together peers and mentors around shared skills.
Seniors can upload resources, recommend projects, and share tech opportunities.
By making progress transparent and mentorship easy, SkillSync turns your society into a connected learning ecosystem.
